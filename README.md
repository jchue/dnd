1793 PC (Post Calamity) - A group of adventurers have been traveling within the country of the Newcross Empire. Some of these adventurers had met each other a month ago when they were called together to defeat a sole cultist from reviving a snake deity Sseth. After their 2 day adventure, the group has continued together, parting paths when they felt their calling was elsewhere. Now we pick up with the remaining adventurers as they come to the town of Faymedow, possibly to start their journey anew.
